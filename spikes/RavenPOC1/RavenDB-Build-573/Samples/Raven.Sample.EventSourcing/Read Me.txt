This sample contains a simple example of Raven's compiled indexes and event sourcing.

Start the server using "Start Raven.ps1", this will start an instance of Raven on port 8080 with a compiled index (ths source for which is found in 
Raven.Sample.EventSourcing.ShoppingCartAggregator).

Run the sample, you should get a message saying the the application has wrote several events to Raven.
Go to the database instance, using http://localhost:8080 and view the events that were entered.

Then hit enter in the sample application, the application will then proceed to read the generated aggregate from the index and display its information.
