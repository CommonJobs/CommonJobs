#NuGet Documentation
Markdown based ASP.NET Web Pages documentation system for NuGet. 

If you're interested in contributing to the documentation for NuGet, you're in the right place.

##Contributing
To contribute to the docs, just clone our repository and work on the Markdown files in the Docs folder. For more details on the process, read our detailed instructions.

##Using NuGet Docs for your own docs
This project includes a website that renders a table of contents based on a directory structure containing markdown files. Feel free to use the website for your own documentation needs, or there is a markdownpages package. Do consider contributing back your improvements though!
