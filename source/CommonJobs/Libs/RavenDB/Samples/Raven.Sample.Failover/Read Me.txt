This sample contains a simple example of Raven's automatic failover facilities.

Start the servers using "Start Raven.ps1", this will start two instance of Raven, one on port 8080 (the master instance) and one on port 8081 (the slaved instance).
Run the "Setup Master To Slave Replication.ps1" script to setup replication from the master to the slave.
  * Note this scripts require curl (http://curl.haxx.se/latest.cgi?curl=win32-nossl) to be on your path.

Run the sample, you should get a message saying that the application has wrote a docuemnt to the master instance and is ready for a server failure.
Stop the master instance (the one from shard1, listening to port 8080), and the hit enter on the sample application.
The application will proceed to try to read the previously saved document from the database, realize that the database is down and automatically switch the the waiting slave instance.
