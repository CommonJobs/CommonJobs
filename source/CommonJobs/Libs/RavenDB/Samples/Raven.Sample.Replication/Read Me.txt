This sample contains a simple example of Raven's replication and conflict resolution.

Start the servers using "Start Raven.ps1", this will start two instance of Raven, one on port 8080 (Master) and one on port 8081 (Slave)

Run the sample, which will create docuemnts with different content but using the same name on both instances.
The application will let you know about that and wait for further input.

You can visit the web UI for each instance to see the two different documents.

Run the "Setup Master To Slave Replication.ps1" script to setup replication from the master instance to the slave instance.
  * Note this scripts require curl (http://curl.haxx.se/latest.cgi?curl=win32-nossl) to be on your path.

Visit the web UI for each instance, and note the conflicted status of the documents.

Hit enter on the sample, it will proceed to try to read the conflicted value, catch the error and allow you to fix the conflict.
The sample will then wait for further input.


Visit the web UI for each instance, and note the conflicted status of the documents was resolved.
Hit enter on the sample, and it will update the document. Note that the document was successfully updated on the slave.
