    <title>Could not reach RavenDB Instance</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>RavenDB instance not reachable</h1>
    <p>When initializing, RaccoonBlog could not reach the RavenDB server configured in web.config, please ensure that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You have a server running in that address.</li>
        <li>That it is reachable from the RaccoonBlog server.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Common causes for this error is to simply not have RavenDB running. RaccoonBlog <i>requires</i> RavenDB server to be running.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you don't have RavenDB already, you can download it from <a href="http://ravendb.net/download">http://ravendb.net/download</a>, after which you can
        simply execute the Raven.Server.exe in the Server directory, to start it.
